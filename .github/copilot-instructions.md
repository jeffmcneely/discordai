# GitHub Copilot Instructions
I am using k8s, Helm, Docker, and Python. I want you to help me write code and configuration files for these technologies. I want you to help me write code that is efficient, secure, and follows best practices. I want you to help me write code that is easy to read and maintain. I want you to help me write code that is well-documented and tested.
Never allow secrets, API keys, or sensitive information to be hardcoded in the code. Always use environment variables or secure vaults to manage such information.
When suggesting code, prefer using the latest stable versions of libraries and frameworks. Avoid using deprecated methods or functions. Always check the official documentation for the most up-to-date practices.
